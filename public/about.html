<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I began my career in healthcare as a Physical Therapist Assistant, 
  constantly striving to improve the patient experience by designing 
  better methods with patient feedback. Through this experience, I 
  learned the importance of understanding the unique needs and goals 
  of each patient and collaborating with a team to create successful 
  outcomes.

<p>Now as a UX Designer, I approach my work with the same focus on user 
  needs and goals, aiming to design intuitive interfaces and experiences. 
  I believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication to 
  drive successful projects.</p>

<p>Drawing on my background in healthcare and passion for UX design, 
  I am excited to create impactful and meaningful user experiences 
  that improve people's lives.</p>
